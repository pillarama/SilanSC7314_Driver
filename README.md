SilanSC7314 Audio Switcher/Processor IC Driver

This is an attempt at creating a driver for the Silan SC7314 IC which I found in a Philips clock radio that I converted into a network music player using a Raspberry Pi 1.

I'm not much of a programmer so I'm sure it's terrible in multiple ways - sorry if it doesn't work for you. I borrowed code from smarter people than I to make it:

Usage requires the smbus library.

I actually wrote this a long time ago - I don't even remember how to use it now but publishing it so it doesn't get lost forever.
